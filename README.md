Basic server app.
It's API oriented, using Phalcon to benefit of exceptional performances.
There a multiple aimed goals about this project, whose:

Here, several features are directly inherited from Phalcon.

## Improvements

I don't pretend this project is able to cover all cases, but I can update it.
So feel free to suggest improvements or/and new features and to fork this project.

I haven't infused knowledge, so I can be wrong. If so don't hesitate to advise me! :)

All criticisms are obviously welcomed.
